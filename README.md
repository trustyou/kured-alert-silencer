# kured-alert-silencer

`kured-alert-silencer` is a tool designed to automatically silence alerts in Alertmanager during the
reboot process of Kubernetes nodes managed by Kured. This ensures that the alerts triggered by node
reboots do not create unnecessary noise in your monitoring system. It provides a configurable
silence duration for each reboot event, and allows the use of Go templates for dynamic silence
matchers.

## Features

- Automatically silences alerts during Kured node reboots
- Configurable silence durations
- Templated silence matchers using `{{ .NodeName }}` and Go templates
- Seamless integration with Kubernetes and Alertmanager
